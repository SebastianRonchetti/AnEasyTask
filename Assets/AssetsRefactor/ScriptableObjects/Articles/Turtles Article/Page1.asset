  - In the last few months there has been a notable increase of sightings of the
    evasive sea turtle species in their native biome off of the coast of Sao Paulo, 
    South America United Federation. \n\nThe former Brazilian coast had been the
    origin of this young species some 22 years ago after a series of enviromental
    disasters caused by North American vessels caused the local biome to undergo
    heavy alterations, prompting the emergence of various new maritime species as
    a result one of which was the devil horned trench turtle.\n\nThis marvelous animal,
    born from human carelessness possesses the ability to secrete a substance at
    the base of their horns that has many medicinal uses, for this reason it has
    been an endangered species from the moment it was discovered as many poachers
    made it their mission to procure specimen of this beast or parts of it to the
    highest bidders. \n\nThe turtle also had to deal with it's main predator in the
    south american sea, the Golden tailed spear dolphin, a species with a quick reproductive
    cycle and a grand apetite for the particular flavor of meat the devil horned
    turtle possesses.
