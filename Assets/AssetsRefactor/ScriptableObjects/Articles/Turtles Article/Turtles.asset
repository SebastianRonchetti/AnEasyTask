  - In the last few months there has been a notable increase of sightings of the
    evasive sea turtle species in their native biome off of the coast of Sao Paulo, 
    South America United Federation. <br><br>The former Brazilian coast had been
    the origin of this young species some 22 years ago after a series of enviromental
    disasters caused by North American vessels caused the local biome to undergo
    heavy alterations, prompting the emergence of various new maritime species as
    a result one of which was the devil horned trench turtle.<br><br>This marvelous
    animal, born from human carelessness possesses the ability to secrete a substance
    at the base of their horns that has many medicinal uses, for this reason it has
    been an endangered species from the moment it was discovered as many poachers
    made it their mission to procure specimen of this beast or parts of it to the
    highest bidders. <br><br>The turtle also had to deal with it's main predator
    in the south american sea, the Golden tailed spear dolphin, a species with a
    quick reproductive cycle and a grand apetite for the particular flavor of meat
    the devil horned turtle possesses.
  - "Due to these factors the Devil horned turtle was driven almost to extinction,
    making it to the endangered species list a mere 4 years after it's first discovery,
    causing the Council of United Earth to organize a strict blockade in the SAUF's
    coast, which was speared by local command officer Jos\xE9 Jorutti of the united
    southern naval defense force in 2029.<br><br>Due to the efforts of officer Jorutti
    and the naval defense force, the Devil horned turtle had a chance to regain some
    ground and start the long way back out of the protected list.\\n\\nLocal marine
    biologist and grandson of Jose Jorutti Joaquin Jorutti said the following: \"Turtles
    are cool. With this development we can expect the tough bastards to make a recovery
    and make it off the endangered species list by 2053\".<br><br>Even with Joaquin's
    positive outlook on the situation, more conservative voices warn that even with
    the Confederation's armorclad naval presence, poachers still manage to smuggle
    out 30 to 40 specimens per year. To these declarations commander Jorutti replied
    \"There is much work to be done but I am already aware of what the poacher's
    next move is going to be, I know it even before they do!\""
