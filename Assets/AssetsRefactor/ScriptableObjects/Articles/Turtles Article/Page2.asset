  - "Due to these factors the Devil horned turtle was driven almost to extinction,
    making it to the endangered species list a mere 4 years after it's first discovery,
    causing the Council of United Earth to organize a strict blockade in the SAUF's
    coast, which was speared by local command officer Jos\xE9 Jorutti of the united
    southern naval defense force in 2029.\\n\\nDue to the efforts of officer Jorutti
    and the naval defense force, the Devil horned turtle had a chance to regain some
    ground and start the long way back out of the protected list."
  - 'Local marine biologist and grandson of Jose Jorutti Joaquin Jorutti said the
    following: "Turtles are cool. With this development we can expect the tough bastards
    to make a recovery and make it off the endangered species list by 2053".\n\nEven
    with Joaquin''s positive outlook on the situation, more conservative voices warn
    that even with the Confederation''s armorclad naval presence, poachers still
    manage to smuggle out 30 to 40 specimens per year. To these declarations commander
    Jorutti replied "There is much work to be done but I am already aware of what
    the poacher''s next move is going to be, I know it even before they do!"'
