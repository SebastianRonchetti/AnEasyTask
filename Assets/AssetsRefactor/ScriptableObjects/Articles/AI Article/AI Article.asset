  - "Kiogle has revealed its newest AI model, Libra 1.5, this model features what
    the industry titan calls an \u201Cexperimental\u201D one quadrillion token context
    window. <br>The new capability allows Libra 1.5 to process very damn big text
    passages \u2013 up to one quadrillion characters \u2013 to understand context,
    meaning and the inherent meaning provided to speech by the human soul. This dwarfs
    previous AI systems which only managed to reach a 85% overall accuracy on imitation
    of the logic proper to us humans, the new model would 'look, act and feel as
    if it were human'. <br><br>Kiogle CEO Maximilian \"Square Max\" Maxwell promises
    that the technology derived from Libra AI will allow to connect to a metaphysical
    aspect of reality and transcend time in order to contact people in the past with
    very accurate simulations of personality. <br><br> On a related interview, AI
    oppositionist have declared that Square Max's promises constitute an infringement
    on human rights as per the agreement signed by the coalition of post nuclear
    calmity in 2045 \"If it brings souls back from the dead it could send them back
    to the wrong place!\" They claim."
  - '"Square Max" had the following to say in the matter: ''...we take very seriously
    the afterlife, we would never mess with the souls laying past the mortal realm.
    Our model simply imitates with great accuracy the personalities of people and
    extrapolates unkown data from known factors like any other AI... only better."
    <br>With these declaration, square Max aims to placate the vocal opposition to
    the new software, allowing for a swift launch of the AI model into the public.<br><br>Lastly,
    we asked the following questions to Max: <br>Will the model permit talks with
    any and all historical figures available for chatting, no matter their predisposition?
    <br>A:"...We aim to bring an educational tool into the world, and as such it
    is important to have all sides present, as such it will be permitted to chat
    with the more... unsavory characters in history. We understand the risks of presenting
    the public with realistic and human depictions of our history''s greatest monsters
    so we have devised a series of failsafes and monitoring protocols in order to
    shut down any AI that attempt to indoctrinate the user."'
