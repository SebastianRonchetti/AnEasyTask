  - "Kiogle has revealed its newest AI model, Libra 1.5, this model features what
    the industry titan calls an \u201Cexperimental\u201D one quadrillion token context
    window. \\n The new capability allows Libra 1.5 to process very damn big text
    passages \u2013 up to one quadrillion characters \u2013 to understand context,
    meaning and the inherent meaning provided to speech by the human soul. This dwarfs
    previous AI systems which only managed to reach a 85% overall accuracy on imitation
    of the logic proper to us humans, the new model would 'look, act and feel as
    if it were human'.\\n\\nKiogle CEO Maximilian \"Square Max\" Maxwell promises
    that the technology derived from Libra AI will allow to connect to a metaphysical
    aspect of reality and transcend time in order to contact people in the past with
    very accurate simulations of personality. \\n\\nOn a related interview, AI oppositionist
    have declared that Square Max's promises constitute an infringement on human
    rights as per the agreement signed by the coalition of post nuclear calmity in
    2045 \"If it brings souls back from the dead it could send them back to the wrong
    place!\" They claim."
