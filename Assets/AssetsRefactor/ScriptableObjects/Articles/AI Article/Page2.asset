  - '"Square Max" had the following to say in the matter: ''...we take very seriously
    the afterlife, we would never mess with the souls laying past the mortal realm.
    Our model simply imitates with great accuracy the personalities of people and
    extrapolates unkown data from known factors like any other AI... only better."
    \n\nWith these declaration, square Max aims to placate the vocal opposition to
    the new software, allowing for a swift launch of the AI model into the public.\n\nLastly,
    we asked the following questions to Max: \nWill the model permit talks with any
    and all historical figures available for chatting, no matter their predisposition?
    \nA:"...We aim to bring an educational tool into the world, and as such it is
    important to have all sides present, as such it will be permitted to chat with
    the more... unsavory characters in history. We understand the risks of presenting
    the public with realistic and human depictions of our history''s greatest monsters
    so we have devised a series of failsafes and monitoring protocols in order to
    shut down any AI that attempt to indoctrinate the user."'
